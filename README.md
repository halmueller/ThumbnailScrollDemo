#  ThumbnailScrollDemo

Imitation of the Photos app browse mode. Horizontally scrolling thumbnails, with detail view above the scrollview. SwiftUI and Bindings exercise. Tested on macOS, iOS, visionOS. 

Follows the concedpts of https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts/driving-changes-in-your-ui-with-state-and-bindings, but this is a vertical layout, not a horizontal layout. Imagine a NavigationSplitViewController thatâ€™s laid out vertically instead of horizontally.
